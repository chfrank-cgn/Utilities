# Rancher

The first script (DOS Batch File) is for setting up Rancher on Docker for Windows, 
the second script is for the same purpose on an GCP VM instance.

On GCP we also create a small syslog receiver based on the official syslog-ng image.

Please note that you need to create the volumes only once!
